The Iterator pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying structure of the collection. It abstracts the traversal logic, allowing clients to iterate over elements in a standardized way.
In .NET, the Iterator pattern is built into the framework through the IEnumerable and IEnumerator interfaces, which are the cornerstone of collection iteration in C#. These interfaces make it easy to implement custom iteration logic for collections in backend applications.

IEnumerable and IEnumerator in .NET

	IEnumerable: Defines a contract for a collection that can be iterated. It has a single method, GetEnumerator(), which returns an IEnumerator.

	IEnumerator: Provides the mechanism to iterate over a collection, with methods/properties like MoveNext(), Current, and Reset().


	Relationship to Iterator Pattern:
	In .NET, IEnumerable represents the "iterable" object, and IEnumerator handles the iteration logic, aligning perfectly with the Iterator pattern.

When to Use the Iterator Pattern in .NET
	The Iterator pattern (via IEnumerable/IEnumerator) is ideal in the following scenarios:
		Custom Collection Traversal:
			When you need to provide a way to iterate over a custom data structure (e.g., a tree, graph, or in-memory cache) in a .NET backend.

			Scenario: A product catalog in an e-commerce API where you want to iterate over products filtered by specific criteria without exposing the underlying storage.
			
			Example: A custom collection of filtered products that implements IEnumerable<Product>.
		
		Decouple Collection from Client Code:
			When you want to hide the internal representation of a collection (e.g., whether it’s a list, array, or database query result).
			
			Scenario: A .NET microservice that retrieves paginated data from a database and exposes it as an iterable result set.
			
			Example: A repository class returning an IEnumerable<Order> for orders matching a query.
		Lazy Evaluation:
			When you want to defer data retrieval or computation until iteration occurs (e.g., for performance optimization in large datasets).
			
			Scenario: A backend system processing streaming data or large datasets, like log entries or real-time analytics.
			
			Example: Using yield return to lazily fetch records from a database.
		Standardized Iteration:
			When you want to leverage .NET’s foreach loop, LINQ, or other iteration-friendly features for custom collections.
		
			Scenario: A .NET API exposing a custom data structure that integrates seamlessly with client code using foreach or LINQ queries.
		
			Example: A custom in-memory cache that supports LINQ operations like Where or Select.
