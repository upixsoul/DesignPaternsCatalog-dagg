Scenarios Where the Visitor Pattern is Recommended:
	Operations on a Complex Structure of Heterogeneous Objects:
		Use Visitor when you have a hierarchy of classes (e.g., a tree or graph) with different types of elements, and you need to perform specific operations on each type without changing their classes.
		Example: In a compiler, processing an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with various node types (e.g., expressions, statements) for tasks like validation, optimization, or code generation.
	Separating Operation Logic from Data Structure:
		When you want to keep your object classes simple and focused on their structure, delegating complex operations to separate Visitor classes.
		Example: In a graphics modeling system with shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines, you can implement operations like drawing, calculating area, or exporting to formats (e.g., SVG, JSON) without modifying the shape classes.
	Adding New Operations Without Modifying Existing Code:
		When you need to add new functionality to an existing class hierarchy while adhering to the Open/Closed Principle (open for extension, closed for modification).
		Example: In a document processing system with elements like paragraphs, images, and tables, you can add operations like word counting, PDF export, or format validation without touching the element classes.
	Operations That Depend on Object Type:
		When operations vary significantly based on the object type, and using polymorphism directly in the classes would lead to tightly coupled or hard-to-maintain code.
		Example: In a billing system with different product types (physical, digital, services), you need to calculate taxes, discounts, or shipping costs specific to each type.
	Accumulating State During Traversal:
		When you need to traverse a structure and collect information or perform operations that depend on the global state of the traversal.
		Example: In a code analysis tool, a Visitor can collect metrics (e.g., line count, cyclomatic complexity) while traversing the AST nodes.
When NOT to Use the Visitor Pattern:
	Unstable Data Structures: If the class hierarchy changes frequently (e.g., adding or removing object types), maintaining Visitors becomes cumbersome, as all Visitors must be updated to handle new types.
	Simple Operations: If the operations are trivial or don’t vary by object type, Visitor adds unnecessary complexity.
	Tight Coupling: If Visitors need access to too many internal details of the objects, it may indicate a poor design.
