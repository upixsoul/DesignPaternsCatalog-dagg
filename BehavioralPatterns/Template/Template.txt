The Template Method pattern is a great choice when you want to define the skeleton of an algorithm 
in a base class but allow subclasses to redefine certain steps without changing the overall structure. 
It’s especially handy in backend development when you're working with consistent workflows 
that have slight variations.

🧠 Best Scenarios to Use Template Pattern
1. Standardized Workflow with Variable Steps
When you have a multi-step process where the sequence is fixed, but individual steps vary.

✅ Example: A data processing pipeline where data is always loaded → cleaned → validated → saved, but each step differs based on data type.

2. Avoiding Code Duplication Across Similar Classes
When subclasses share a core algorithm but each has custom behavior in certain parts.

✅ Example: Generating reports in different formats (PDF, Excel, HTML) that follow the same process but format-specific logic varies.

3. Encapsulating Invariant Logic
When business logic needs to be enforced across implementations.

✅ Example: In a web API response builder, always attach metadata and apply security filters, but allow customization of the actual payload content.

4. Implementing Hooks for Optional Customization
You can provide empty methods in the base class that subclasses can optionally override.

✅ Example: Base authentication handler might have a hook for audit logging that’s only used in certain subclasses.
