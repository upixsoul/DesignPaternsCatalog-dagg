The Chain of Responsibility design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows you to pass a request along a chain of handlers, where each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it to the next handler. 
It promotes loose coupling by decoupling the sender of a request from its receivers, giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.

Best Scenarios for Using Chain of Responsibility

	Multiple Handlers for a Request:
		Scenario: You have a system where a request can be processed by multiple objects, and the appropriate handler is determined at runtime based on certain conditions.
		Example: In an ASP.NET Core application, you might implement middleware to handle HTTP requests. Each middleware component (e.g., authentication, logging, error handling) can process the request or pass it to the next middleware in the pipeline.
		Why Use It?: The pattern allows each handler to focus on a specific task, making the system modular and extensible.
	Dynamic Handler Selection:
		Scenario: The handler for a request is not known in advance and depends on runtime conditions.
		Example: In a customer support system, a ticket might be processed by different support levels (e.g., Level 1 Support, Level 2 Support, Manager). Each level checks if it can handle the ticket based on its severity or complexity and passes it to the next level if needed.
		Why Use It?: The pattern supports dynamic decision-making without hardcoding the handler logic.
	Decoupling Request Sender from Receiver:
		Scenario: You want to avoid tightly coupling the sender of a request to a specific receiver, allowing flexibility in how requests are processed.
		Example: In a .NET-based event logging system, log messages (e.g., errors, warnings, info) are sent to a chain of loggers (e.g., console logger, file logger, database logger). Each logger decides whether to handle the message based on its log level.
		Why Use It?: The sender doesn’t need to know which logger will handle the message, promoting loose coupling.
	Sequential Processing with Optional Handlers:
		Scenario: A request needs to go through a series of processing steps, and some steps may be skipped based on conditions.
		Example: In a .NET Core API for processing purchase orders, you might have a chain of validation handlers (e.g., check inventory, verify payment, validate shipping address). Each handler validates one aspect and passes the order to the next handler if valid.
		Why Use It?: It allows you to break down complex processing into smaller, reusable components.
	Extensibility and Maintainability:
		Scenario: You need a system where new handlers can be added or existing ones modified without changing the core logic.
		Example: In a .NET-based approval workflow system, different approvers (e.g., Team Lead, Manager, Director) can be added to the chain dynamically to approve or reject requests (e.g., expense approvals).
		Why Use It?: The pattern supports the Open/Closed Principle, allowing new handlers to be added without modifying existing code.
	Error Handling or Exception Processing:
		Scenario: You need to handle errors or exceptions in a flexible, hierarchical manner.
		Example: In a .NET application, you could implement a chain of exception handlers where each handler attempts to handle a specific type of exception (e.g., DbException, NullReferenceException) before passing unhandled exceptions to a default handler.
		Why Use It?: It provides a clean way to centralize and organize error-handling logic.
Key Characteristics of Ideal Use Cases
	Multiple Potential Handlers: The request can be handled by one or more objects in a chain.

	Dynamic Decision-Making: The handler is chosen at runtime based on conditions or request properties.
	
	Loose Coupling: The sender and receiver(s) should not be tightly coupled.

	Sequential or Hierarchical Processing: The request needs to pass through a series of steps or checks.

	Extensibility: The system should allow adding or removing handlers easily.
