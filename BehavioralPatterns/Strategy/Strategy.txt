The **Strategy Pattern** shines brightest when you want to swap out behaviors 
or algorithms without modifying the classes that use them. 
Think of it like giving your objects a flexible playbook—they 
can switch tactics on the fly depending on what’s needed.

Here are the prime use cases where it earns its place:

### 🧠 Best Scenarios to Use Strategy Pattern

#### ✅ 1. **Dynamic Behavior Selection**
You need objects to change their behavior at runtime depending on the context.
- **Example**: Switching between multiple sorting algorithms based on dataset size or type.

#### ✅ 2. **Avoiding Long `if-else` or `switch` Logic**
Too many branches can get ugly—Strategy replaces conditionals with clean polymorphic code.
- **Example**: Tax calculation based on country or payment type logic in a billing system.

#### ✅ 3. **Supporting Open/Closed Principle**
You want to add new behaviors without modifying existing code.
- **Example**: Adding new authentication methods (OAuth, JWT, SAML) without touching the login flow.

#### ✅ 4. **Encapsulating Algorithms**
Different versions of an algorithm should be isolated to prevent duplication or coupling.
- **Example**: Compression strategies (ZIP, RAR, GZIP) in a file service.

#### ✅ 5. **Improving Unit Testability**
By injecting interchangeable strategies, you can mock or stub specific behaviors easily.
- **Example**: Injecting fake pricing rules for testing your ecommerce backend logic.

#### ✅ 6. **Plug-and-Play with Dependency Injection**
Especially in .NET Core, you can register multiple implementations and inject the one needed.
- **Example**: Logging strategies—console, file, database—swapped based on environment.

### 🛠️ Backend Contexts Where It Excels
| Case | Use Strategy Pattern for... |
|------|------------------------------|
| API Behavior | Input validation, transformation, serialization strategies |
| Business Rules | Dynamic discount or pricing logic |
| Middleware | Swappable policies (auth, throttling, caching) |
| ETL Pipelines | Data cleansing and enrichment algorithms |
| Azure Batch / Async Tasks | Injecting different task processing logic |
