The Memento pattern shines when you need to capture an object’s state for possible restoration later—without exposing its internal structure. Let’s break down the best use cases where this pattern really earns its keep:

✅ Ideal Scenarios for Using Memento
📝 1. Undo/Redo Functionality
Why: Let users revert changes step by step, common in editors (text, graphic, code).

Example: An IDE or form builder storing snapshots of a design so the user can backtrack without affecting internal logic.

📋 2. Checkpointing in Long Operations
Why: Preserve and roll back state in case something fails partway.

Example: A game saving player progress; if an error occurs, restore the last known good state.

🎮 3. Stateful UI Components
Why: Maintain temporary or draft versions of component states.

Example: A multi-step form or wizard preserving the user’s input across steps.

🔀 4. Versioning Configurations
Why: Allow tracking and restoration of previous configurations/settings.

Example: Infrastructure as code setups (Terraform or Kubernetes manifests) where rollback to a stable deployment is needed.

⏱️ 5. Simulation & Prediction Systems
Why: Test hypothetical changes without affecting real data.

Example: A financial modeling tool preserving previous calculation states for comparisons.

💡 Best Practices
Avoid using it if object state is trivial or stateless—it adds unnecessary complexity.

Combine with other patterns like Command (for undo actions) or State (for transitions).

Keep memento objects lightweight—large snapshots can consume memory rapidly if not managed properly.
